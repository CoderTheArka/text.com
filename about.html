            <p align="center" class="sk2">Welcome to the Greenfield Convent School! We firmly believe that education should be for life, not just for a living. Education should serve not only to the develop one's intelligence and skills. But also help to broaden one's Outlook and make a person useful to society and the world at large.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school is focused on raising the aspirations and expectations of all our students. We have excellent enrichment programs and at one time we could have students climbing a mountain performing in a concert, competing in a match, designing a battery powered card or visiting an art gallery! We want them to be fully aware of their immense potential and have the confidence to achieve it as they grow.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCS develops young people into compassionate future leaders and as I said at the beginning. Every picture tells a story.The faces of our students show how they feel about our school-I feel the same way too.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I invite you to join me in building a 'can do' future for your son or daughter.</p>

Our instruction does not end in the classroom only; it spreads concern for the society and environment as well. We stand for Social Justice, environmental concern, fitness of mind and body. We uphold ethics and unbiased judgement and groom our students Intelligence and character, for we know nothing can stop a person with the right attitude from achieving his/her goal.<br>
